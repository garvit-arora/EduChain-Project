**Blockchain-based Esports Tracking Platform**
*Project Overview*
This project is a blockchain-based solution developed during the EDU CHAIN BUILD in Delhi. It focuses on the esports ecosystem, addressing pain points in tracking, transparency, and data integrity within the esports community. The platform leverages blockchain technology to provide an immutable, transparent, and efficient system to track esports tournaments, player performance, team statistics, and more.

**Key Features**
Decentralized Data Management: Uses blockchain to store and manage esports data securely, ensuring that all game results, player stats, and team rankings are transparent and tamper-proof.
Esports Tournament Tracking: Provides a transparent, real-time view of ongoing and past tournaments, including match scores, team rankings, and individual player performances.
Player Reputation System: A blockchain-based reputation system that ensures the integrity of player rankings and achievements.
Smart Contracts: Implements smart contracts to manage tournament rules, prize distribution, and team/player agreements.
Fairness & Transparency: All tournament results and performance metrics are publicly accessible and cannot be altered, eliminating the potential for cheating or data manipulation.
Pain Points Addressed
Lack of Transparency: Traditional esports platforms often suffer from lack of transparency in tournament results and player statistics. With blockchain, all data is immutable and publicly verifiable.
Data Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of match results and player performance stats, protecting against manipulation or fraudulent reporting.
Inefficient Prize Distribution: Blockchainâ€™s smart contracts automate and ensure transparent and fair distribution of tournament prizes.
Centralized Control: Traditional systems are often prone to centralization, allowing for potential biases or errors. Blockchain decentralizes control, ensuring that no single party can alter the outcome.
Technology Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum (or any other suitable blockchain platform)
Smart Contracts: Solidity for Ethereum smart contracts
Frontend: React.js (or any suitable frontend framework)
Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or any backend framework)
Database: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or decentralized storage for non-blockchain data
Wallet Integration: MetaMask or other Web3 wallet integration for transactions and authentication
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (v6 or higher)
